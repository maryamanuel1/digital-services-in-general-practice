#### Introduction 

Patients have seen a fundamental shift in how general practices deliver primary care services. As GPs adapt to coronavirus pandemic and national lockdowns, access to quality digital health services has proved more important now than ever.

Redeveloped in 2021, the GP Patient Survey — a national survey of patients’ experiences of general practice — reflects the changes to primary care services due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Our analysis aims to shed light on the use of and barriers to accessing online GP services in England.

### Appointment Types

#### Remote appointments are now as common as in person appointments

The rise of remote appointments is perhaps the most striking change to GP practice since the pandemic. 

For decades, face-to-face appointments dominated, making up 90% of appointment types. However, for the first time in history, more remote appointments took place in April 2020 than face-to-face appointments. 

Appointment types have balanced out since the first national lockdown, with the share of remote appointments increasing to almost 50% of appointment types in 2021.


#### How do patients feel about remote appointments? 

Research from the Office for National Statistics found that, in August 2020, 64% of people said they would be 'comfortable' or 'very comfortable' attending an online appointment with a health professional. However,  patients over 70 (53%) or with an underlying health condition* (57%) weren't as comfortable with online appointments.

While most patients would be comfortable with an online appointment, 64% of UK patients still would prefer in-person consultations in the future. 

*ONS Glossary of what is considered an underlying health condition. This may be different to how the GP Patient Survey 2021 defines a long term health condition

### Online GP services

#### 44% of patients have used an GP online service in the last 12 months

The Lloyds UK Consumer Digital Index 2021 -- the UK's largest measure of digital capability and financial behaviour - found that more consumers use digital tools and websites to manage their physical (37%) and mental health (25%) this year. This is compared with 89% for banking and 60% for accessing local council information.

Indeed, in 2021, 44% of patients have used at least one GP online service. Of those who used an online GP patient service, ordering repeat prescriptions was the most popular activity (26%), followed by booking an appointment online (19%).


#### On average, patients with long term health conditions used online GP services 13% more than patients without a long term condition.

Patients with long term conditions were also more than twice as likely to order repeat prescriptions than patients without long term conditions, this particularly noticeable for patients with mental health conditions (40%) or another-long term health condition (40%)

                  <span class="nhsuk-u-visually-hidden">Information: </span>
                  <p>Yet, online hasn't fully taken off. More than half (56%) of all patients surveyed have not used any GP online services.</p>
                </div>


#### The oldest and youngest age groups were least likely to use online GP services, but for different reasons.

<p><b>Figure 3.</b> The proportion of online service use between survey respondents (by age group) that used an online services within the last 12 months (as of March 2021). Source: GP Patient Survey 2021.</p>

Over 75s are 12% less likely to use online GP services, with 68% not using any online GP service in the last 12 months.

Interestingly, 16-24s were second least likely to use online GP services, with only 41% using an online GP service in the last 12 months. However, morbidity increases with age, so 16-24s are less likely to need GP services than older age groups.


<div class="nhsuk-inset-text">
                  <span class="nhsuk-u-visually-hidden">Information: </span>
                  <p>According to Ofcom's Digital Exclusion Survey, 18% of digitally excluded over 75s would be willing to go online to access health services.</p>
                </div>

But why aren't patients aged 75 and over using online GP services? In a recent report on digital inclusion, Age UK found that 42% of over 75 do not use the internet.  

Furthermore, a lack of digital skills among the over 75+ age group (79%) was the most common reason for not using the internet. The next most common reasons were a lack of trust in the internet (39%) and not having good enough access to equipment and/or broadband (30%).

### GP practice websites

#### Looking through GP practises website to look for information or access services is getting easier for some groups, but harder for others

Overall, patients are finding it 4% harder to use GP practice websites since 2018. However, some groups are finding these websites harder to use than others. 

While there is a 3% increase in 16-24s saying they find it easy to use their GP practises website to look for information or access services. Since 2018, there has been an 8% decrease for patients over 75 and a 5% decrease for patients with long term health conditions, saying it is easy to use their GP practises website to look for information or access services.


However, of all these groups, patients with a learning disability are twice as likely to find GP practice websites ‘Not at all easy” to use than the national average.
