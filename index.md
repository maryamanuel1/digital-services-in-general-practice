<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>

As more people use digital tools and websites to manage their physical (37%) and mental health (25%) in 2021 [[1](https://www.lloydsbank.com/banking-with-us/whats-happening/consumer-digital-index.html)], access to quality online health services is crucial to the digital transformation of the NHS.

Given that 89% of consumers use digital tools for online banking and 60% for accessing local council information [[1](https://www.lloydsbank.com/banking-with-us/whats-happening/consumer-digital-index.html)], there is great potential to expand digital health services in the UK.

Our analysis builds on the GP Patient Survey 2021 — a national survey of patients’ experiences of general practice — to shed light on the use of--and barriers to--accessing online general practice services in England since the coronavirus pandemic [[2](https://gp-patient.co.uk/)].

### Remote appointments are now as common as in person appointments

{% include remote_appts.html %}

<p><strong>Figure 1.</strong> Proportion of appointment types betweeen survey respondents, where 'Remote' includes both Telephone and Online appointments. Source: GP Patient Survey 2021.</p>

For the first time in history, [more remote appointments](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/appointments-in-general-practice/april-2020) took place in April 2020 than face-to-face appointments.

In previous surveys, face-to-face appointments were the dominant appointment type, making up 90% of the patient appointments. In 2021, however, 50% of patients reported having a remote appointment (compared with 10% in 2020).

### How do patients feel about remote appointments?

Patients are more likely to say their needs were met in their last face-to-face appointment (95%) than in their last remote appointment (92%).

Research from the [Office for National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandwellbeing/bulletins/coronavirusandthesocialimpactsongreatbritain/4september2020#coronavirus-and-the-social-impacts-on-great-britain-data) found that, in August 2020, 64% of people said they would be ‘comfortable’ or ‘very comfortable’ attending an online appointment with a health professional. However, so over 70 (53%) or with an underlying health condition\* (57%) weren’t as comfortable with online appointments.

While most patients would be comfortable with an online appointment, 64% of UK patients still would [prefer in-person consultations in the future](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qJ-z2q88IVDCgZLhWOhbbZa8Kj3_OMrU8XxBBcWvPes/edit#).

This may be different to how the GP Patient Survey 2021 defines as a long term health condition](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandwellbeing/bulletins/coronavirusandthesocialimpactsongreatbritain/4september2020#glossary)

<h2 id="Online Services">Online Services</h2>

### Almost half (44%) of patients have used an online GP service in the last 12 months

Ordering repeat prescriptions was the most popular activity among those who used an online service (26%), followed by booking an appointment online (19%). Yet, online GP services haven't fully taken off. More than half (56%) of all patients surveyed have not used any online service.

### Patients with long term health conditions used online GP services 13% more than patients without long term conditions

Patients with a long term condition were also more than twice as likely to order repeat prescriptions, 4% more likely to access their medical records online and 2% more likely to book appointments online.

### The oldest and youngest age groups were least likely to use online GP services

{% include online_activities_all.html %}

<p><b>Figure 3.</b> The proportion of online service use between survey respondents (by age group) that used an online services within the last 12 months (as of March 2021). Source: GP Patient Survey 2021.</p>

Over 75s are 12% less likely to use online services, with 68% not using any online GP service in the last 12 months.

Interestingly, 16-24s were second least likely to use online GP services, with 41% using an online service in the last 12 months (compared with 44% nationally).

### Why aren't patients aged 75+ using online GP services?

In a [recent report on digital inclusion](https://www.ageuk.org.uk/globalassets/age-uk/documents/reports-and-publications/reports-and-briefings/active-communities/digital-inclusion-in-the-pandemic-final-march-2021.pdf), Age UK found that 42% of aged 75 and over do not use the internet.

Furthermore, a lack of digital skills among the over 75+ age group (79%) was the most common reason for not using the internet. The next most common reasons were a lack of trust in the internet (39%) and not having good enough access to equipment and/or broadband (30%).

Ofcom's [Digital Exclusion Survey](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0025/217834/adults-media-use-and-attitudes-report-2020-21.pdf) also found that 18% of digitally excluded adults aged 75 and over would be willing to go online to access health services.

<h2 id="Web Accessability">Web Accessability</h2>

### Using GP practice websites is getting slightly harder year on year, particularly for those aged 75 and over

{% include ease_of_use.html %}

<p><b>Figure 4.</b> The proportion of survey respondents aged 75 and over that found it easy use their GP practice's website to look for information or access services. Source: GP Patient Survey 2021.</p>

A quarter (25%) of patients who used their GP practice's website say it was 'not easy' to look for information or access services on the website, compared with 22% in 2018.

Patients with a learning disability are twice as likely to find GP practice websites 'not at all easy" to use than patients who do not have a learning disability.

<hr class="nhsuk-u-margin-top-0 nhsuk-u-margin-bottom-6">

<h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

Patients have seen a fundamental shift in how general practices deliver primary care services. The GP Patient Survey has shown that patients are getting more familiar with online GP services such as remote appointments and ordering repeat prescriptions online.

And yet, some barriers remain: more than half of patients haven’t used any online GP service in the last 12 months, more patients felt in-person appointments met their needs, and GP practices websites need to be more accessible.

Moving forward, accessible, inclusive, and personalised healthcare services will be key to overcoming these barriers, building a solid foundation for further digital transformation.
