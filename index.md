Patients have seen a fundamental shift in how general practices deliver primary care services. As GPs adapt to coronavirus pandemic and national lockdowns, access to quality digital health services has proved more important now than ever.

Redeveloped in 2021, the GP Patient Survey — a national survey of patients’ experiences of general practice — reflects the changes to primary care services due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our analysis aims to shed light on the use of and barriers to accessing online GP services in England.

### Remote appointments are now as common as in person appointments

The rise of remote appointments is perhaps the most striking change to GP practice since the pandemic.

For decades, face-to-face appointments dominated, making up 90% of appointment types. However, for the first time in history, more remote appointments took place in April 2020 than face-to-face appointments.

Appointment types have balanced out since the first national lockdown, with the share of remote appointments increasing to almost 50% of appointment types in 2021.

#### How do patients feel about remote appointments?

Research from the Office for National Statistics found that 64% of people said they would be 'comfortable' or 'very comfortable' attending an online appointment with a health professional in August 2020. However, patients over 70 (53%) or with an underlying health condition\* (57%) weren't as comfortable with online appointments.

While most patients would be comfortable with an online appointment, 64% of UK patients still would prefer in-person consultations in the future.
